# Curator

A modset manager for Stardew Valley

Managing Stardew Valley mods is cumbersome. The mods are not tied to a specific save game, hence you need to manually remember to enable and disable the correct mods before loading a save. Disabling happens by manually editing the mod's folder name by adding a `.` in front of the name and enabling by removing the dot.

Curator is a desktop application for MacOS, Windows and Linux that makes it easier to enable/disable your mods and **lets you create named sets that can be activated with a single click**.

## Development

Curator is an Electron app bootstrapped with `npm init electron-app@latest`.

To run the development build, run `yarn start` in this folder.
